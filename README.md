# MS_Covid_Outcomes
An investigation into Multiple Scelerosis (MS) and Covid Risk with relation to different types of immunosuppressant therapies 

This project originally started as a submission for the CS 109 "Probability in the Real World" challenge project in the Fall of 2021. 
Eventually, it became the proposal I used for research with the Institute for Systems Biology, studying MS using multiomics machine learning. 

This initial project involved probabilistic and naive machine learning techniques including: 
- Bayesian Networks
- Niave Bayes
- Rejection Sampling
- Poisson Approximations
